# MNIST dataset handwritten digit recognition
MNIST ("Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology") is the de facto “hello world” dataset of computer vision. Since its release in 1999, this classic dataset of handwritten images has served as the basis for benchmarking classification algorithms. As new machine learning techniques emerge, MNIST remains a reliable resource for researchers and learners alike.

The goal of the competition is to classify the handwritten digits into 1 of 10 labels namely 0-9. We have a dataset of 42,000 handwritten digits each of which is represented as a 28x28 pixel.
